1. What is motivating you to make a move and what is truly important to you in a new career at Truist?
I am looking for an opportunity where I can apply my deep experience in cloud security architecture to drive measurable, enterprise-wide impact. Over the last several years, I have led complex initiatives across Azure, AWS, and hybrid environments — from implementing Microsoft Purview for data governance and compliance, to designing identity, access, and cryptographic controls that meet regulatory and business demands.

What excites me about Truist is the scale, complexity, and clear commitment to integrated cybersecurity as a business enabler. I value environments where security is treated not as a checkpoint but as an embedded part of design and delivery, and where cross-functional collaboration is essential to success.

In my next role, it’s important to me that I:

Lead strategic, enterprise-grade cloud security solutions that span IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

Work closely with architecture, governance, application, and operations teams to ensure security is baked in from the first design conversation.

Operate in a forward-looking, policy-driven environment where security architecture influences business outcomes, not just compliance.

2. If you started tomorrow, how would you approach the role?
If I were to join tomorrow as Cloud Cybersecurity Solution Principal Architect, I would focus on three parallel tracks from day one:

Listen & Understand the Landscape – Meet with Corporate Information Security, key Line of Business stakeholders, and Enterprise Architecture to map the current state of cloud adoption, security posture, and governance maturity. This ensures my recommendations fit Truist’s priorities and existing frameworks.

Quick-Win Security Alignment – Identify near-term, high-impact improvements in identity & access management, logging & monitoring, and cloud governance controls that can be implemented quickly, demonstrating value early while building credibility.

Strategic Security Roadmap – Begin shaping a longer-term, integrated cloud security architecture blueprint that covers application security, cryptography, IAM, monitoring, and compliance, ensuring it aligns with Truist’s cloud migration, digital integration, and modernization plans. This would include evaluating and selecting cloud-native and third-party security tools, always balancing technical fit, risk reduction, and operational sustainability.

My approach combines hands-on architectural design, executive-level communication, and a proven track record of building consensus across technical and non-technical teams — exactly what’s needed to ensure that cloud security is not an afterthought, but a core enabler of Truist’s digital strategy.



ell me about your experience as it relates to above
In my current role at Truist, I have been deeply engaged in designing and implementing secure, enterprise-scale cloud architectures across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS environments, with a strong focus on security, governance, and compliance. My experience spans end-to-end — from conceptual architecture and security requirement gathering, through vendor selection and integration, to implementation and operational handover.

I have hands-on expertise in identity and access management, cryptography, application security, logging, monitoring, and governance frameworks — all aligned with best practices such as NIST, CIS Benchmarks, and Zero Trust principles. I have worked closely with Enterprise Architecture, Corporate Information Security, Data Governance, and various LOB teams to design security architectures that are both robust and adaptable to evolving regulatory and business needs.

One of my key strengths is bridging technical depth with business alignment — ensuring that every cloud security solution I design not only meets stringent cybersecurity requirements but also enables agility, scalability, and cost efficiency for the business.

What professional accomplishment are you most proud of?
I am most proud of leading a highly complex Microsoft Purview Data Governance program to a successful enterprise rollout at Truist. This initiative required aligning multiple high-impact stakeholders — including the Architecture team, Data Governance team, Cloud Platform team, and Office Applications team — each with unique priorities and constraints.

The project involved designing and implementing enterprise-wide data classification, labeling, and protection capabilities integrated with Microsoft Purview and M365 security controls, ensuring compliance with internal governance frameworks and regulatory requirements. I navigated complex technical challenges, from hybrid cloud integration to role-based access control and encryption policy enforcement, while also managing the organizational change aspects to ensure smooth adoption.

Delivering this project on time and within scope not only elevated Truist’s data governance maturity but also set a foundation for scalable, compliant cloud adoption across multiple lines of business. It exemplified my ability to combine deep technical expertise, stakeholder management, and strategic vision — qualities I will bring to the Cloud Cybersecurity Solution Principal Architect role.
