1. What are you most proud of in your career?
I am most proud of leading the highly complex Microsoft Purview data governance project to a successful delivery at Truist. This was a multi-stakeholder initiative involving the Architecture Team, Data Governance Team, Cloud Platform Team, and Office Applications Team, each with differing priorities and technical constraints.

The project demanded deep knowledge of compliance frameworks, identity and access management (IAM), data security policies, and cross-cloud integration. I coordinated across all teams to align requirements, manage dependencies, and design a secure, scalable architecture that adhered to Truist’s data governance standards and met strict compliance timelines.

The solution not only satisfied regulatory and business requirements, but also established a repeatable architectural model for future governance-driven initiatives. This model directly informed the L2 and L3 architecture diagrams I developed — which encapsulate my philosophy of secure-by-design, policy-driven cloud architectures with clearly defined identity layers, observability pipelines, and compliance guardrails.

2. Describe your cloud architecture philosophy and design experience.
My approach to cloud architecture blends security, scalability, and observability from the ground up. I believe in designing at multiple abstraction levels — starting from L2 diagrams that define major service groupings, down to L3 diagrams that detail service-to-service interactions, IAM role boundaries, and operational monitoring flows.

For example, my recent work translating Azure-based governance and monitoring architecture into an AWS-native equivalent required mapping:

Azure Purview → AWS Glue Data Catalog / Lake Formation

Azure Monitor & Sentinel → CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Security Hub, GuardDuty

Azure Active Directory → Amazon Cognito / IAM / SSO

This translation demanded a deep understanding of both ecosystems, ensuring that compliance and security controls remained intact while leveraging AWS-native services. My IAM designs always incorporate least-privilege access, permission boundaries, and policy-based controls, aligning with Truist’s security posture.

3. Key skills and experiences relevant to this position:

Cloud Platforms: AWS (advanced), Azure (advanced), hybrid integration strategies

Identity & Access Management: IAM, Cognito, SSO, Azure AD, permission boundaries, role-based access design

Compliance & Security: CISSP certified; led initiatives with Wiz, CloudGuard, AWS Security Hub, Azure Security Center

Observability & Monitoring: End-to-end logging from CloudTrail into CloudWatch, metric-based alerting via AWS native tools and integration with SIEM solutions

Architecture Leadership: Creation of L2/L3 diagrams to align technical design with business and compliance goals

Project Leadership: Driving multi-team projects like Microsoft Purview across architecture, data governance, cybersecurity, and application teams

Stakeholder Management: Proven record of building consensus across LOBs, platform teams, and CISO’s office

4. Why I am a strong fit for this Cloud Architect role:
I combine hands-on technical depth with strategic architectural thinking, proven through delivering large-scale, compliance-heavy cloud solutions within Truist. I understand the internal governance landscape, the criticality of secure and compliant designs, and the necessity of translating complex multi-cloud architectures into clear, actionable roadmaps for all stakeholders.

My Purview project success demonstrates my ability to lead difficult initiatives under tight timelines, while my L2/L3 architecture frameworks reflect my ongoing commitment to building secure, observable, and policy-driven cloud solutions that can scale with Truist’s future needs.
